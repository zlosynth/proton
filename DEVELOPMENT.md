# Development

## Cheat sheet

Run formatting, linter and unit tests:

``` sh
make
```

And more under `hack/` and in the `Makefile`.

## Gerbers, BOM and CPL

I extensivelly use https://github.com/Bouni/kicad-jlcpcb-tools to deal with the
matters listed in the title, and to prepare project for manufacture.
